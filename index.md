Took a semi-supervised approach to emotional analysis.<br>
Combined the power of **LSTM** Neural networks and Emotion lexicons to detect depressive sentiments in text.<br>
Made use of:
1. Twitter API-data source
2. NRC emotion lexicon - labelling the dataset
3. Word2Vec-Word Emeddings
4. Streamlit-User-interface <br>

##### Analysis Tableau

In an attempt to understand the state of mental health in people working in the Tech Industry <br> and the general population,I carried out an analysis and prepared a dashboard on Tableau<br>
Using the following datasets:
1. Kaggle-dataset[Name of dataset](/Link to the dataset)
2. Carlifonia -dataset[name of dataset](/link to the dataset).<br>

Leveraged the power of recurrent neural networks to grade academic essays.<br>
Made use of:
1. [Kaggle-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes)
2. Word2Vec
3. LSTM neural network
4. Cohen-Kappa score as the evaluation metric <br>

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-View%20Code-lightgrey)](https://github.com/Gail529/Taylor)

A content-based reccomendation system which can suggest different Taylor Swift songs depending on my mood.<br>
Made use of:
1. Web scraping - Scrape song lyrics
2. Spotify API -Gather audio features
3. NRC emotion lexicon -calculate song emotion scores
4. Cosine similarity - calculate similarity scores
5. Streamlit - test out the recommendations <br>

 Investigated the different factors contributing to the growth of a chess player by analysing 20000 games from lichess.org. 

####  Predicting the outcome of a game of chess
 
 [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/colab-Run%20colab%20notebook-orange)](link-to-our-project) 
 
Used supervised machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression,Desicion Trees and Random Forest) to predict the outcome of a game.
